Make functions where you will use it multiple times.
Bash coders:
function function_name
{
}
C coders:
function_name () {

}

But are the same

Function can accept arguments
$1 to first argument $2 to second argument, etc
Function needs to be coded before execute

Can't return a variable
Just a number.
If we need a variable, we can make a global variable to use outside the function
Functions just return number

Without number will return the state of the function

Scope:
By default a variable is global scope
If you make a local variable it will be seen only inside the function

local var="Value"
