Careful with case sensitive
variable=content

To use the variable use with $:
$variable

Quotes treats:
bash treats ' and " differnet
'' this will use the characters literally they are
"" Will use all less $ ` \

Ex:
greetings='Hello World'
echo $greetings
Hello World

greetings2="New $greetings"
echo $greetings2
New Hello World

Executing code and saving in a variable
user=$(whoami)
user2=`whoami`

The previous executiions will execute in a subshell
