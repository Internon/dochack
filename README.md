# inter-dochack
The content i'm adding here are things that i saw during penetration testing or securing/making security alarms.

On useful-commands i will add commands used on red-teaming (during my penetration tests) and blue-teaming (used when i make alarms)

On useful-documentation i will add some documentation found in some courses or books that i think are useful to remember

On useful-blue-alarms i will add some alarms that i think are useful on any network. If there is some IDS suricata rule i will add it in suricata-rules subfolder. If there is no suricata rule, i will add the idea in alarms subfolders.
