Suricata have some rules that knows when someone is scaning on the ports 1433, 3306, 5432, 5800-5820 so we won't scan this ports in order to don't alert the blue team.

In addition we won't get the version of the services as this is alerting too on some suricatas

sudo nmap -T4 -p0-1432,1434-3305,3307-5431,5433-5799,5821-65535 -PS22,53,80,135,443,445,993,995,1521,3389,5985,5986,8080,8081,8090,9001,9002 --open -oA {HOST} {HOST}
