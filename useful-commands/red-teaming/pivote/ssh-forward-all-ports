####sshuttle

Forward all traffic:

sshuttle -r username@sshserver 0.0.0.0/0

    Use the sshuttle -r parameter to specify a remote server.

    By default sshuttle will automatically choose a method to use. Override with the sshuttle --method parameter.

    There is a shortcut for 0.0.0.0/0 for those that value their wrists:

    sshuttle -r username@sshserver 0/0

    For ‘My VPN broke and need a temporary solution FAST to access local IPv4 addresses’:

    sshuttle --dns -NHr username@sshserver 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16

If you would also like your DNS queries to be proxied through the DNS server of the server you are connect to:

sshuttle --dns -r username@sshserver 0/0


####Dynamic Port Forwarding and Proxychains
Opens a local port that forwards all traffic headed to that port to the destination machine, essentially allowing you to access new networks that are not directly accessible, and perform tasks such as nmap scanning without the need of installing nmap on the pivot host.

# Alice:8080 -> Bob:22 -> Bob & Charlie's Network:0-65535

# On Alice
ssh root@bob -D 8080
echo '[ProxyList]' > proxychains.conf
echo 'socks4 127.0.0.1 8080' >> proxychains.conf
proxychains nmap -T4 -n -Pn -sT -F -p 80 charlie
IMPORTANT NOTE on Proxychains and Nmap:

- Use -sT -Pn when proxychaining nmap!
- ICMP (nmap host detection), UDP, nmap OS detection and non-fully established TCP connections (nmap SYN scan) will not work through proxychain, and will result in leakage, meaning your connections will go through as if without having a proxy at all, including revealing your IP address.
- Why didn't proxychain work with nmap in the OffsecVM, but works on main Kali box? OffsecVM -> running proxychain nmap as ROOT -> defaults to SYN scan -> proxychain fails to establish SOCKS connection. Main Kali -> running proxychain nmap as non-privileged user -> defaults to TCP scan -> proxychain successfully establishes SOCKS connection.
- No SYN scans, ICMP, UDP and OS detection: https://security.stackexchange.com/a/122562
- Nmap and proxychains: https://ntu-offsec.github.io/blog/articles/nmap-proxychains/
- ICMP/pings will not work with SOCKS proxy, as SOCKS is on layer 5 that acts as a proxy for TCP and UDP connections, of which ICMP requests are not. https://superuser.com/a/1030803
